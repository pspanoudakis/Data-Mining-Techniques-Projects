### Running the notebook
The notebook has custom module dependencies, included in the `modules` folder.

To run the notebook in Google Colab, you can upload the `modules` folder in the runtime `/content` folder. Of course, the Goodreads Books dataset must be provided as well.

In notebook cell #2, we can set the dataset path (`CSV_PATH`).
The `USE_GDRIVE` should be set to `False`.
